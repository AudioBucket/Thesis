In this folder the code used for the impementation of the MVDR beamformer with the different examined methods for RTF estimation can be found.
The implementation was done in MATLAB.
-Kalman.m: MVDR beamformer with the full derived Kalman filter for RTf estimation
-RTF_recursive.m: MVDR beamformer with the Kalman filter with a zero measurement equation for RTF estimation. 
-GEVD.m: MVDR beamformer with the known GEVD-based RTF estimation where a GEVD is computed for each frame

Furthermore the used sound samples can be found as well
- line_moving_speech27.wav: The speech signal which consist of 5 microphone signals and where the speech source is moving at a speed of 2.7km/h
- diffuse_noise.wav: The used added noise
- female_speech.wav: original signle microphone speech source signal
